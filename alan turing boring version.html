          Alan Turing, sometimes called the "father of modern computer science", was a British mathematician remembered today for the crucial role he played
          in the Allied victory over Nazi Germany during the Second World War.
          <br /> <br />
          <h2>"Father of Computer Science"</h2>
          In 1936, Turing wrote a paper that posited the idea of a "Universal Machine"
          that could "be used to compute any computable sequence" (Turing 1936). In March 1946, he turned this theoretical idea into a practical plan for
          an electronic computer capable of running program, the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE).
          <br /> <br />
          <h2>Breaking Enigma and WW2</h2>
          In September 1939, Turing was joined by other mathematicians at Bletchley Park, where he developed
          a new machine (the 'Bombe') which was capable of breaking the ciphers used by German armed forces with their Enigma machine--a breakthrough which is
          estimated to have shortened the war by almost 2 years.
          <br /> <br />
          <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          In 1950, Turing published a philosophical paper that included the idea now known as the Turing Test--a way to compare human and machine outputs through
          and "imitation game". The paper became a key contribution to the field of Artificial Intelligence.
          <br /> <br />
          <h2>Convicted for Gross Indecency</h2>
          Despite Turing's many accomplishments and contributions both in WW2 and computer science, he was victim to the laws in England during
          the time he lived which criminalized consenting homosexual acts under the Labouchere Amendment as "gross indecency". Rather than serve a
          sentence in prison, he accepted hormonal treatment which was essentially "chemical castration". As a result of his conviction he was
          forced to abandon his work with the government and in 1954, he died of cyanide of poisoning. Although his death was ruled a suicide,
          some experts believe it may have been an accident, while many conspiracists suggest he was killed because he was a "security risk".
          Nevertheless, Turing died an untimely death at the age of 41, and his following an Internet campaign in 2009, British Prime Minister
          Gordon Brown issued a public apology on behalf of the British government for the "appalling way [Turing] was treated" and in December
          2013, Alan Turing was given a posthumous royal pardon by Queen Elizabeth, formally cancelling his criminal conviction.
